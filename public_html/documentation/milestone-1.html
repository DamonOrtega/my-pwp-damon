    <h1>Personal Website Project</h1>
    <h2>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong>  This project will be a showcase of my custom car stereo installation and fabrication skills on a Toyota FJ Cruiser</p>
        <p><strong>Audience:</strong> This site will be geared towards car stereo enthusiasts and more specifically Toyota truck/FJ Cruiser enthusiasts.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong>  The primary focus of this site will be to exhibit my      fabrication skills and to showcase FJ Cruiser customer stereo installation ideas. The secondary goal will be to drive sponsers and possible customers to my linked social media profiles.</p>
    <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong>  Billy Basshead</p>
        <p><strong>Profession:</strong>  Co-owner of a popular local bar and live music venue.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong>  Uses both an iPhone and Android devices. Uses Mac for the work office and an Apple based POS in the bar. Uses a Windows based PC at home. He has average computer knowledge. Billy owns many audiophile grade stereo components and associated audio tech. He owns multiple vehicles.</p>
        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>  Very busy work and social life. Billy unwinds by visiting automotive enthusiast forums/websites, car stereo build forms, and spends lots of downtime on Instagram. Billy gets most of his ideas from these websites. He car camps and off-roads quite a bit in the summers. Billy likes to drive. Billy is also an avid mountain-bike rider.</p>
        <p><strong>Frustration and Needs:</strong>  Billy hate’s a poor-sounding stereo both in his vehicles and home. Billy is not pleased with the upgrade he had done last year at a local shop. It is not up to his aesthetic or sound quality standards. Billy needs ideas to correct the shortcomings of the previous shop's work before the summer camping season begins.</p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong>  Billy needs ideas for a subwoofer and a custom amplifier mounting rack. He does not want to lose any storage for his camping gear due to his aftermarket stereo components. Billy is hoping to find other FJ Cruiser owners with custom stereo builds online.</p>
        <p><strong>User Story:</strong>  I need to see some examples/ideas for improving my Toyota’s stereo build.</p>
