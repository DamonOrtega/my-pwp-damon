    <h1>Personal Website Project Milestone 2</h1>
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>My site will be one page, will scroll horizontally, and consist of the following sections:</p>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong>  The stylized title will state the purpose of this webpage. It will be centered and overlaid on a large image of my FJ Cruiser to help reinforce the viewer's understanding of the information to be presented. A link will be strategically placed in the title text to provide definitions for some of the more obscure car stereo terminology used on my site.</p>
        <p><strong>About My Stereo Build:</strong>  I will provide a brief history of vehicle ownership and previous stereo installation experiences.  I will also go over other supporting upgrades I have made to my truck. Further information will be provided regarding components used in the installation process as well as why I chose these components. I will also provide the steps taken in the installation/fabrication process. Buttons linking to the appropriate portfolio images will be nested within the text to act as my navigation bar to quickly access certain photos from my gallery. The main page will also act as the first image in my gallery as the site will scroll horizontally.</p>
        <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong>  As mentioned previously the site will scroll horizontally in either direction either by using the arrow buttons, clicking on photos listed in the gallery, clicking on the buttons in the "About my Stereo Build" section, or swiping in either direction on a device with a touch interface. Text will be provided along with the images giving details as to what is in the photograph. This responsive image gallery will include 4-8 images of different stages of my stereo build process.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Media Links:</strong>  Social media icons will be placed in the footer to provide further information regarding my build or to make contact with me.</p>

    <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
        <p>The site will feature one layout and will be fully responsive on small and large screens.</p>
